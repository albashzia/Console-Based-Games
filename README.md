# Console-Based-Games

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of **console-based games and interactive programs** developed primarily for **logic building, practice, and leisure-time coding**.  
The focus of this repository is not graphics or UI, but **core programming fundamentals**, clean flow, and problem-solving through simple game mechanics.

The programs here are intentionally kept **terminal/console based** to strengthen understanding of:

- Control flow  
- User input handling  
- Game state management  
- Logical decision making  

---

## Purpose of This Repository

The main objectives of this repository are:

- To practice programming fundamentals using small, self-contained games  
- To improve logical thinking through interactive programs  
- To experiment with game flow and state management in a simple environment  
- To build consistency by implementing similar ideas in multiple languages  

This repository is also used as a **learning log**, where code readability and incremental improvement matter more than complexity.

## Languages Used

- **Java** – for object-oriented and structured console programs  
- **Python** – for rapid prototyping and logic-focused scripting  

Each language is used to reinforce its own strengths while solving similar problems.
